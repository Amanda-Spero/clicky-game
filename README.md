REACT CLICKY GAME
=============
On loading users are presented with 12 unique images.  The challenge is to not click the same image more than once a round.  This is made more challenging because each time a user makes a guess the images reshuffle.  Users gain one point for each correctly clicked image, but if one is clicked twice the round is over.  The user's score as well as the highest recorded score are shown on the top bar.
